# Val_ADHD
This project is a simple overlay I created because I had trouble keeping track of the crosshair while playing Valorant. I would constantly lose my when flicking or aiming quickly, and it was tough to stay focused on such a small target. Itâ€™s really just something I made to help me focus better and not get frustrated by losing sight of the crosshair.  

Although its very simple, I want to keep trying to find ways to make it better than it is right now.
I'll try and update whenever I can :)

Install:
Go to the "Releases" and download the zip, everything you need is in there and precompiled :D

Use:
(I'm still trying to find a better way to switch crosshair seamlessly, but its going to take me a while.)
1. Run Valorant (and make sure its in windowed mode)
2. Run Val_ADHD
3. Select what line you want to use for the gun you are holding (I did not make one for the snipers.)
4. And Enjoy :3
